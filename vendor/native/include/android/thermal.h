/**
 * Provides an estimate of how much thermal headroom the device currently has before
 * hitting severe throttling.
 *
 * Note that this only attempts to track the headroom of slow-moving sensors, such as
 * the skin temperature sensor. This means that there is no benefit to calling this function
 * more frequently than about once per second, and attempted to call significantly
 * more frequently may result in the function returning {@code NaN}.
 *
 * In addition, in order to be able to provide an accurate forecast, the system does
 * not attempt to forecast until it has multiple temperature samples from which to
 * extrapolate. This should only take a few seconds from the time of the first call,
 * but during this time, no forecasting will occur, and the current headroom will be
 * returned regardless of the value of {@code forecastSeconds}.
 *
 * The value returned is a non-negative float that represents how much of the thermal envelope
 * is in use (or is forecasted to be in use). A value of 1.0 indicates that the device is
 * (or will be) throttled at {@link #ATHERMAL_STATUS_SEVERE}. Such throttling can affect the
 * CPU, GPU, and other subsystems. Values may exceed 1.0, but there is no implied mapping
 * to specific thermal levels beyond that point. This means that values greater than 1.0
 * may correspond to {@link #ATHERMAL_STATUS_SEVERE}, but may also represent heavier throttling.
 *
 * A value of 0.0 corresponds to a fixed distance from 1.0, but does not correspond to any
 * particular thermal status or temperature. Values on (0.0, 1.0] may be expected to scale
 * linearly with temperature, though temperature changes over time are typically not linear.
 * Negative values will be clamped to 0.0 before returning.
 *
 * Available since API level 31.
 *
 * @param manager The manager instance to use.
 *                Acquired via {@link AThermal_acquireManager}.
 * @param forecastSeconds how many seconds into the future to forecast. Given that device
 *                        conditions may change at any time, forecasts from further in the
 *                        future will likely be less accurate than forecasts in the near future.
 * @return a value greater than equal to 0.0, where 1.0 indicates the SEVERE throttling threshold,
 *         as described above. Returns NaN if the device does not support this functionality or
 *         if this function is called significantly faster than once per second.
