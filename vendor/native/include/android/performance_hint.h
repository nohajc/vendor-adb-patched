 *
 * A Session represents a group of threads with an inter-related workload such that hints for
 * their performance should be considered as a unit. The threads in a given session should be
 * long-life and not created or destroyed dynamically.
 *
 * <p>Each session is expected to have a periodic workload with a target duration for each
 * cycle. The cycle duration is likely greater than the target work duration to allow other
 * parts of the pipeline to run within the available budget. For example, a renderer thread may
 * work at 60hz in order to produce frames at the display's frame but have a target work
 * duration of only 6ms.</p>
 *
 * <p>After each cycle of work, the client is expected to use
 * {@link APerformanceHint_reportActualWorkDuration} to report the actual time taken to
 * complete.</p>

 *    <li>Update a sessions target duration for each cycle of work
