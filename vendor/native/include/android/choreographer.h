/**
 * @addtogroup Choreographer
 *
 * Choreographer coordinates the timing of frame rendering. This is the C version of the
 * android.view.Choreographer object in Java.
 *
 * As of API level 33, apps can follow proper frame pacing and even choose a future frame to render.
 * The API is used as follows:
 * 1. The app posts an {@link AChoreographer_vsyncCallback} to Choreographer to run on the next
 * frame.
 * 2. The callback is called when it is the time to start the frame with an {@link
 * AChoreographerFrameCallbackData} payload: information about multiple possible frame
 * timelines.
 * 3. Apps can choose a frame timeline from the {@link
 * AChoreographerFrameCallbackData} payload, depending on the frame deadline they can meet when
 * rendering the frame and their desired presentation time, and subsequently
 * {@link ASurfaceTransaction_setFrameTimeline notify SurfaceFlinger}
 * of the choice. Alternatively, for apps that do not choose a frame timeline, their frame would be
 * presented at the earliest possible timeline.
 *   - The preferred frame timeline is the default frame
 * timeline that the platform scheduled for the app, based on device configuration.
 * 4. SurfaceFlinger attempts to follow the chosen frame timeline, by not applying transactions or
 * latching buffers before the desired presentation time.
 *
