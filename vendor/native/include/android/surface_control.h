 *
 * You can register for changes in the refresh rate using
 * \a AChoreographer_registerRefreshRateCallback.
 *
 * \param frameRate is the intended frame rate of this surface, in frames per second. 0 is a special
 * value that indicates the app will accept the system's choice for the display frame rate, which is
 * the default behavior if this function isn't called. The frameRate param does <em>not</em> need to
 * be a valid refresh rate for this device's display - e.g., it's fine to pass 30fps to a device
 * that can only run the display at 60fps.
 *
 * \param compatibility The frame rate compatibility of this surface. The compatibility value may
 * influence the system's choice of display frame rate. To specify a compatibility use the
 * ANATIVEWINDOW_FRAME_RATE_COMPATIBILITY_* enum. This parameter is ignored when frameRate is 0.
 *
 * \param changeFrameRateStrategy Whether display refresh rate transitions caused by this
 * surface should be seamless. A seamless transition is one that doesn't have any visual
 * interruptions, such as a black screen for a second or two. See the
 * ANATIVEWINDOW_CHANGE_FRAME_RATE_* values. This parameter is ignored when frameRate is 0.
 *
 * Available since API level 31.

/**
 * Indicate whether to enable backpressure for buffer submission to a given SurfaceControl.
 *
 * By default backpressure is disabled, which means submitting a buffer prior to receiving
 * a callback for the previous buffer could lead to that buffer being "dropped". In cases
 * where you are selecting for latency, this may be a desirable behavior! We had a new buffer
 * ready, why shouldn't we show it?
 *
 * When back pressure is enabled, each buffer will be required to be presented
 * before it is released and the callback delivered
 * (absent the whole SurfaceControl being removed).
 *
 * Most apps are likely to have some sort of backpressure internally, e.g. you are
 * waiting on the callback from frame N-2 before starting frame N. In high refresh
 * rate scenarios there may not be much time between SurfaceFlinger completing frame
 * N-1 (and therefore releasing buffer N-2) and beginning frame N. This means
 * your app may not have enough time to respond in the callback. Using this flag
 * and pushing buffers earlier for server side queuing will be advantageous
 * in such cases.
 *
 * \param transaction The transaction in which to make the change.
 * \param surface_control The ASurfaceControl on which to control buffer backpressure behavior.
 * \param enableBackPressure Whether to enable back pressure.
